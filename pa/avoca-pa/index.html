            <h3>Avoca, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The community was incorporated as a borough in 1871. Its original name was “Pleasant Valley.” However, in 1887, it changed its name to “Avoca,” because the name 'Pleasant Valley' was already used elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It was named after Avoca, County Wicklow, in Ireland. The following year, on October 10, 1888, the borough suffered a major tragedy when dozens of its own residents were killed in a train wreck known as the Mud Run Disaster. It occurred at 8:02 p.m., when two trains collided in Kidder Township, Carbon County, Pennsylvania. A majority of the 64 killed were from Avoca. The other casualties were from Scranton, Moosic and other neighboring communities.</p>
